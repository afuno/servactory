# Result

All services have the result of their work. For example, in case of success this call:

```ruby
service_result = UsersService::Accept.call!(user: User.first)
```

Will return this:

```ruby
#<Servactory::Result:0x0000000107ad9e88 @user="...">
```

And then work with th–µ result in this way:

```ruby
Notification::SendJob.perform_later(service_result.user.id)
```
