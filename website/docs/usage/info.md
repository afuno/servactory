# Info

From outside the service, can get information about its input, internal, and output attributes.

It is valuable, when implementing complex class handling, for example.

For example, the following attributes are described in a service:

```ruby
class BuildFullName < ApplicationService::Base
  input :first_name, type: String
  input :middle_name, type: String, required: false
  input :last_name, type: String

  internal :prepared_full_name, type: String

  output :full_name, type: String

  # ...
end
```

Get information about them in the following ways:

```ruby
BuildFullName.info

# => <Servactory::Info::Result:0x00000001118c7078 @inputs=[:first_name, :middle_name, :last_name], @internals=[:prepared_full_name], @outputs=[:full_name]>
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.inputs

# => [:first_name, :middle_name, :last_name]
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.internals

# => [:prepared_full_name]
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.outputs

# => [:full_name]
```
