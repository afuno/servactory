# Call

Services can only be called via `.call` and `.call!` methods.

The `.call` method will only fail if it catches an exception in the input arguments. Internal and output attributes, as well as methods for failures â€” all this will be collected in the result.

The `.call!` method will fail if it catches any exception.

### Via `.call`

```ruby
UsersService::Accept.call(user: User.first)
```

### Via `.call!`

```ruby
UsersService::Accept.call!(user: User.first)
```

### Info

From outside the service, can get information about its input, internal, and output attributes.

It is valuable, when implementing complex class handling, for example.

For example, the following attributes are described in a service:

```ruby
class BuildFullName < ApplicationService::Base
  input :first_name, type: String
  input :middle_name, type: String, required: false
  input :last_name, type: String

  internal :prepared_full_name, type: String

  output :full_name, type: String

  # ...
end
```

Get information about them in the following ways:

```ruby
BuildFullName.info

# => <Servactory::Info::Result:0x00000001118c7078 @inputs=[:first_name, :middle_name, :last_name], @internals=[:prepared_full_name], @outputs=[:full_name]>
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.inputs

# => [:first_name, :middle_name, :last_name]
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.internals

# => [:prepared_full_name]
```

```ruby
BuildFullName.info.outputs

# => [:full_name]
```
